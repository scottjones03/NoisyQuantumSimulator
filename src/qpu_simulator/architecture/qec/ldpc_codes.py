# LDPC Code Implementation
#
# High-rate low-density parity-check codes.
#
# Code families:
#   - Hypergraph product codes
#   - Lifted product codes
#   - Bivariate bicycle codes
#   - Quantum Tanner codes
#
# Advantages:
#   - Higher encoding rate than surface code
#   - Constant overhead for some families
#   - Potentially lower qubit requirements
#
# Challenges addressed:
#   - Non-local stabilizer measurements
#   - Syndrome extraction circuits
#   - Decoder complexity
#
# Integration:
#   - Movement-based connectivity for non-local checks
#   - Parallelism analysis for neutral atoms
