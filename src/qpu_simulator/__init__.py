# QPU Simulator: Cross-Platform Quantum Processing Unit Architecture Simulator
#
# A multi-scale simulation framework for comparing quantum hardware architectures
# including neutral atom arrays, trapped ions, and cavity QED systems.
#
# Architecture:
#   Layer 0 (Micro-Physics): Hardware-specific physics simulations (1-3 qubits)
#   Layer 1 (Primitives): Hardware-abstracted operation API
#   Layer 2 (Architecture): System-level scheduling, QEC, and compilation
