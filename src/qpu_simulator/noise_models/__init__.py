# Noise Models
#
# CPTP error channels and noise representations.
#
# This module provides:
#   - Standard error channel definitions
#   - Conversion between representations
#   - Composition of error channels
#   - Extraction from micro-physics simulations
#
# Error channel types:
#   - Pauli channels (depolarizing, dephasing, bit-flip)
#   - Amplitude damping (T1)
#   - Phase damping (T2)
#   - Leakage channels
#   - Correlated errors
#
# Representations:
#   - Kraus operators
#   - Pauli transfer matrix (PTM)
#   - Chi matrix
#   - Stim-compatible error rates
