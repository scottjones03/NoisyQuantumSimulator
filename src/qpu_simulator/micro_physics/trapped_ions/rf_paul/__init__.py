# RF Paul Trap Micro-Physics
#
# Models for RF Paul traps including micromotion effects.
#
# Physics included:
#   - RF trapping potential (pseudopotential approximation)
#   - Micromotion and its effect on gates
#   - Excess micromotion from stray fields
#   - Similar gate models to QCCD but with RF-specific corrections
