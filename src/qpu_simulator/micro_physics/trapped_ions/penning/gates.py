# Penning Trap Gate Models
#
# Entangling gates via collective motional modes in Penning traps.
#
# Physics included:
#   - 2D crystal collective modes (drumhead, tilt, etc.)
#   - Spin-dependent optical dipole force
#   - Long-range Ising-type interactions
#   - Geometric phase accumulation
#
# Inputs (Hardware Parameters):
#   - Magnetic field strength
#   - Rotation frequency
#   - Laser parameters for spin-dependent force
#   - Crystal size and geometry
#
# Outputs:
#   - Effective spin-spin coupling matrix
#   - Gate duration
#   - Infidelity from motional decoherence
