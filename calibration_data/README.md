# Calibration Data
#
# This directory stores pre-computed calibration data from micro-physics simulations.
# Data is organized by hardware platform and parameter regime.
#
# Structure:
#   neutral_atoms/
#     rydberg_cz/          # CZ gate calibrations
#       n53_*.json         # For n=53 Rydberg state
#       n70_*.json         # For n=70 Rydberg state
#     single_qubit/        # Single-qubit gate calibrations
#     movement/            # AOD/SLM movement calibrations
#
#   trapped_ions/
#     ms_gates/            # Mølmer-Sørensen gate data
#     shuttling/           # Ion transport calibrations
#
# Data format:
#   JSON files containing:
#   - Parameter values used
#   - Resulting error rates
#   - Gate durations
#   - Metadata (date, simulation details)
#
# Usage:
#   These files are generated by running micro-physics simulations
#   and are loaded by the primitives layer during initialization.
